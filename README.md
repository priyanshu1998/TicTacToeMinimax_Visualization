# TicTacToeMinimax_Visualization

Visualizing minimax algorithm for TIC-TAC-TOE using pydot(Graphviz frontend)



###### Language: Python                      
###### module  : pydot (a Graphviz frontend) 


### MOTIVATION:
    Back in 2019 I found that someone has created a implementation that generated graphs for recursive calls.
    https://github.com/Bishalsarang/Recursion-Tree-Visualizer/tree/v-1.1.0

    In 4th Year when a task was given in AI subject to solve problems using minmax.
    It was the perfect problem statement to test out the module.
    We didnt need to write a code but I felt it intersting so i tried visualizing it.




### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
    " Take 10 different tree with many different levels and use alpha beta pruning algorithm as well as minimax algorithm. "


### Notes:
    While processing the png files its very likely that one is bound to run into memory problem.
    So, took it as a investigatory and wrote the relevant code with all investigation compiled in a report.

    Notes releated to used Decorator logic used in recursive tree visualizer.
    (has the exact explation to how function parameters are parsed.)
